# FTC_Centerstage_HumanPlayer_ML

Hello, my name is ShreySuri. This past year, I was part of the First Tech Challenge Centerstage Season ([Info Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc)). One of the main elemnts of the season this year was the role of the human player. This year, the human player role includes a fair bit of strategic thinking, which I want to try my hand at emulating using a machine learning. Wish me luck!
